Welcome to JAW's documentation!
==========================================================

What is JAW?
------------

JAW (Just Another (Pytorch) Wrapper) is, like is name speaks for itself, a little Pytorch wrapper and above all a proposal of project architecture for Machine Learning.
The main idea is to show how write is own little ML framework based on Pytorch, but with an architecture flexible enought to permit the use of another
library (such as keras or Tensorflow).

Here you will find a tutorial for how use JAW for create its ML project and the documentation of the JAW package.

.. important::

   This package isn't a reimplementation of well-based wrapper such as `Pytorch lightning <https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/>`_, but only a helping tool for
   writing its own ML framework.
