Tutorial
========

The goal of this tutorial is to show how create a JAW project, i.e. a project with the JAW template architecture and some built-in methods. You can also decide
to keep the architecture but without using the JAW package. The most important is the architecture.

For made this example more concrete, we will reimplement this
`tutorial <https://teaching.pages.centralesupelec.fr/deeplearning-lectures-build/00-pytorch-fashionMnist.html>`_ in our own way (credits to `Jeremy Fix
<https://github.com/jeremyfix>`_). If you want know more about the machine learning, we strongly recommend this `webbook <https://mlweb.loria.fr/book/en/index.html>`_, 
especially this `definition <https://mlweb.loria.fr/book/en/machinelearning.html>`_. We can find the final example project inside the folder ``src/example/``.

.. note::
   
   This tutorial hasn't the pretention to teach you how write a better network model, but only to provide a base of code for neophytes or peoples
   looking for a base for their own architectures.
